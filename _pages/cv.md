Education
======
* Masters in Computer Science, New York University Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, 2025 (expected)
* Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science, BITS Pilani-Hyderabad Campus, 2022

Work experience
======
* Aug 2022 - Aug 2023: Software Engineer
  * Microsoft
  * Edge Browser - Autofill: Deployed a unique algorithm to cluster form fields across URLs in a large-scale graph system to improve the automated Autofill form-filling experience, thereby increasing the overall autofill accuracy by 12% in Edge. Scaled the services to handle loads of up to 100,000 requests a second by introducing caching techniques and routing based on regions. Built client-side heuristics to determine various kinds of Date of Birth and Address Fields across forms. Introduced a Cosmos SDK layer to the autofill microservice that introduced compiler-level type-checks and helped developers build new micro-services that interact with the Azure Cosmos DB.

* Spring 2022: Research Intern
  * Nanyang Technological University
  * Speech Lab: Worked on improving currently existing Speaker Diarization Pipelines using Deep Learning. Improved the current baseline models by using new speech encoders to accurately classify different types of background noise and remove unwanted noise segments, reducing the overall error compared to the state-of-the-art models.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Chng Eng Siong

* Fall 2021: Research Intern
  * University of British Columbia
  * Intelligent Data Science Lab: Worked on using Deep learning in the field of De Novo Molecule Generation. Introduced Self Attention Mechanism in Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) that improved upon the rewards metric in the generation of new molecules.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Apurva Narayan
 
* Summer 2021: Software Engineering Intern
  * Microsoft
  * Outlook Threat Intelligence Team: Developed a Query Translation framework to help ease the process of migrating from ElasticSearch to Azure Kusto. Reduced the load on the current AIR(Automated Investigation and Response), thereby significantly reducing costs

* Summer 2020: Machine Learning Intern
  * Spacejoy
  * Recommendation Engine: Designed and implemented an efficient color tagging system by extracting the foreground image and clustering it to extract colors from a large dataset of furniture pictures. This was an integral part of their recommendation engine which I also helped bootstrap.
  
* Summer 2019: Research Intern
  * Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research
  * Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) in the Design of Nuclear Reactor Core: Used PSO to find out the optimum architecture of the control rods in the design of the nuclear reactor core to maximize efficiency. A novel variation of the algorithm was proposed and its applications were discussed in NP-Hard problems and the reactor core.
  * * Supervisor: Dr. M.L. Jaylal
