**Grad Student** at **New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematics** | **Ex-Microsoft Software Engineer**

## About me
I'm currently a Computer Science Graduate student at New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I'm deeply passionate about the potential of Computer Science to revolutionize our lives. My journey has been marked by a blend of practical software engineering experience at Microsoft and research internships that delve into the intricacies of applications of Machine Learning that span all the way from building Generative Adverserial Networks to help synthesize new medicines to using Deep Learning to understand hunab voice by Speaker Diarization.

These experiences have not only fortified my foundation in computer science but also highlighted the joy and fulfillment derived from applying this knowledge to solve diverse challenges. They have solidified my belief in the ongoing and future significance of computer science and machine learning in creating innovative solutions that improve lives globally.
