**Grad Student** at **New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematics** | **Ex-Microsoft Software Engineer**

## About me
I'm currently a graduate student at New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I am deeply passionate about the potential of Computer Science to revolutionize our lives. My journey has been marked by a blend of practical software engineering experience at Microsoft and research internships that delve into the intricacies of computer science and unique applications to Machine Learning.

At Microsoft, I worked in the Edge browser team to improve the automatic form filing experience in the browser.  This work underscored the critical importance of building real-world systems that are not only efficient but also resilient. My efforts were geared towards optimizing data processing capabilities and improving system architecture to handle substantial user loads without compromising performance. I Scaled the services to handle loads of up to 100,000 requests a second by introducing caching techniques and routing based on regions. 

My research internships have allowed me to explore the frontier of modern machine learning, where we worked on employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve the drug discovery process and help the process of synthesizing new medicines. 

These experiences have not only fortified my foundation in computer science but also highlighted the joy and fulfillment derived from applying this knowledge to solve diverse challenges. They have solidified my belief in the ongoing and future significance of computer science and machine learning in creating innovative solutions that improve lives globally.
