**Grad Student** at **New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematics** | **Ex-Microsoft Software Engineer**

## About me
I'm a Computer Science Graduate student at New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. My journey has been marked by a blend of practical software engineering experience at Microsoft and research internships that delve into the intricacies of applications of Machine Learning that span all the way from building Generative Adverserial Networks to help synthesize new medicines to using Deep Learning to understand human voice through Speaker Diarization.

Working on complex problems like Drug Discovery was hugely gratifying. Working on Speaker Diarization and using nature-inspired algorithms in the design of a Reactor Core opened my eyes to the immense possibilities of using Artificial Intelligence. The experience of building and running large-scale systems at Microsoft provided me with a strong foundation to deliver impact. 

The above experiences of applying Computer Science and Machine Learning to solve and productize solutions to challenges in various diverse areas not only provided me with a strong foundation but were immensely gratifying and solidified my belief that Computer Science will continue to have a deeper impact on our lives.
